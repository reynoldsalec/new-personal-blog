**tl;dr Align code samples with specific value propositions of your product. If you can't show value in < 3 seconds, don't bother. Only show what you need to and make sure it looks good using a tool like Carbon, Asciinema, or GifCap.**

Marketing dev tools is difficult for many reasons. Often you're marketing to multiple audiences with dramatically different needs, from different types of developers to the businesses that actually pay for the tools. Most marketing advice is targeted at dissimilar industries. And to top it off, your "product" may be nothing more than a CLI tool.

Even a simple object like an apple has a thousand more aesthetic possibilities for photos, designs, and emotional appeals than code does. Hungry for terminal?

Side note: if you're the OSS maintainer that thinks "marketing" is for commercial froods and sellouts, then you're either blessed with a tool so useful that you're showered with cash by grateful developers, or you're a saint. Just remember that most saints didn't meet happy ends.

- The best marketing tries to focus on the true value props - the things you've tested and proven with customer research - and communicates them in the most succinct way possible.
- Emotional appeals combined with meaty code is a winning combination.

GifCap: Good for short clips beyond the terminal (live IDE example, browser showoffs). Decent fidelity. Not for interactive samples.
