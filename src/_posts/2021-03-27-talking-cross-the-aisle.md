## Drinking Beer in an ATV With a Republican

The early spring sun filters through a stand of live oak as we cruise across a churning dirtscape, roiled by the recent passage of a masticator. Steve and I both live in a rural community in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California, and we originally came together working on a community issue related to land access.

We both grew up in this community, and working from common ground we've grown a relationship of mutual respect. Alongside that respect has lived a deep mutual curiosity. As two men who share history, who link their identity to this land that we're currently ambling about in Steve's ATV, we are also very different.

Where Steve is an avid bowhunter, I'm a birdwatcher and a lifelong vegetarian. Where Steve has worked his way up in the construction trade to become the successful owner of a plastering business, I've always worked in professional services as a programmer. I would struggle to name a close acquaintance of mine who has less than a bachelor's degree, while Steve is proud to have become independently wealthy without a college education. And where I typically vote Democratic, Steve votes Republican.

We chat about the land around us as we make our leisurely way up the hill. The ATV stalls out for a moment, but surprises me at its implacable advance; it's one of those four-seater rigs with an open canopy that looks like if a golf cart got knocked up by a Humvee. In the back is a Yeti cooler filled with 805 beer; both of us have come up enough in life to enjoy a craft brew.

We reach a spot where we can see most of the little valley and Steve kills the engine. With a little of preamble, we get down to our intended business: it's time to talk politics.

## What Makes a Conservative?

In our conversation we cover a lot of ground. Education. Healthcare. Foreign policy and the rise of China. Corruption. Social justice. Throughout it all, a question keeps popping up in my head: what makes a modern American conservative? For that matter, what makes a modern American liberal? What about our perspectives is so irreconcilable that we've reached the deepest polarization in American politics since the Civil War?

### Differences in Culture

Much has been written about the culture wars and their role in shaping American politics. It would be disingenuous if I said that Steve and I didn't reflect typecasting of "typical" conservatives and liberals; take as evidence the comparison of our interests/businesses/education. When one of Steve's heavy equipment operators pulls up in a skid steer, I wonder what he sees, Steve in his camo sweater, me wearing my Cotopaxi puff jacket. Down to our cars (guess who drives the Volt and who drives the F-150?) we could be parodies.

How much of these differences actually matter? In talking about education, we do talk briefly about the role of higher education. Both of us agree that the American education system needs to improve. Both of us also agree that spending money on early childhood education is the best investment. Both of us are dubious about plans to lavish further money on higher education, but it's unsurprising that I'm more willing to consider the merits of a university degree. Despite the fact that my history degree isn't very applicable to my current work, I do believe that being surrounded by driven professionals led me to my current success and is a strong benefit of going to a well-respected university. Much of this thinking is driven by [The Meritocracy Trap](), a review of American inequality that makes a strong argument that high-quality university education is increasingly restricted to a wealthy caste which self-perpetuates not because it passes money to its heirs, but provides them degrees from Yale, Harvard, and other schools.

In the course of our conversation, however, this is really a trifling difference in policy opinion. If anything, I feel guilty about even directly talking about higher education. It's clear that Steve takes pride in not needing a piece of paper from an institution, but I'm worried that I'll seem like a snob, a college boy who looks down on those who haven't climbed the ivory tower. It also hits a sensitive point of privilege: I'm embarrassed that I live in a country that gives such disproportionate rewards to university graduates, who earn nearly double in their lifetimes over those with only a high school diploma. Steve's success proves that demographics aren't destiny, but just because you're lucky enough to be talking to an exception to the rule doesn't mean you don't think about it every time a waitress brings you your food or you're chatting with your mechanic.

If anything, our cultural differences are points of attraction. I like talking to hunters, because every hunter I've known has a deep respect for the animals they stalk, their habits, and their environment. My interest in wildlife and ecology is extremely similar to a hunter's, up until the moment the trigger is pressed or the string released.

Likewise both of us are amply familiar with each other's cultures, partly because of stereotype, but also because we have lived in an area that has a healthy mix of working class and "professional" people. Most of Steve's contracts are with school districts and other governmental entities. He's either working within the bureaucracy or with wealthy Californians; both groups are well populated by pencil-neck liberals like myself. Similarly, having grown up here in the sticks I'm not spooked by guns, camo, and the occasional domestic beer. After a 12 year intermission living in the Bay Area, it was almost a relief to come back to a place where a political discussion doesn't revolve around nitpicking liberal policy.
