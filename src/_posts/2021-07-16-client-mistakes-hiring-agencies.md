## What Are The Biggest Mistakes Clients Make When Hiring a Web Agency?

It was a good question. After ten years running digital agencies, I've seen a wide range of organizations trying to tackle the same problem: how do we find the ideal partner for our 6-figure web implementation project? It's a nearly impossible task, particularly when you're making an evaluation based off of a few conversations, a portfolio, and perhaps a warm recommendation.

## Tip #1: Evaluate Multiple Agencies.

You wouldn't get your roof re-done without talking to a couple contractors. So why do companies hire agencies without talking to multiple potential partners?

Rushed timelines, a lack of existing connections, or faith in a personal connection can force your hand. Likewise, interviewing agencies can be a thankless task that seems meaningless. Indeed, without a framework for evaluation, it can be meaningless! However, picking the first agency that walks in the door or is recommended to you is the same as random selection. You might as well use a weeji board to sift through Upwork.

Identify multiple agencies that pass an initial screening test. Ideally, you'll have 2-5 candidate for further evaluation after initial screening. As an agency owner, whenever I'm competing against more than 4 other agencies, I fall back on default proposals and dedicate less time to the process. Effectively evaluating more than a handful of agencies is difficult, if not outright impossible.

What if you have an existing relationsihp with a firm that you love working with, or at the very least think does decent work? Changing horses midstream can be costly, but don't succumb to vendor lock. Just because you liked working with a firm last year doesn't mean someone better isn't out there. Service quality can degrade; working at an agency is hard and the best teammembers are continually finding new positions.

Ultimatley you need to always be networking with potential new partners. Be clear that you have a current partner, but think about ways you can "try" a new agency. Maybe there's a small one-off project you can give them. Perhaps they're open to doing some off-the-cuff brainstorming sessions. Most savvy agency owners will agree to have regular monthly calls with you to see how things are going and offer advice. Yes, this is them nurturing you as a lead. Use it as an opportunity to nurture them as a prospect. Come with tough problems and use those meetings as a chance to see how they think through problems or to see what type of expertise they have on their team.


## Tip #2: Be Explicit About Budget.

If you have a healthy network and are regularly in-touch with "qualified" agencies, the problem then becomes selecting the best agency for a particular job.

Start with initial screening. What are the hard parameters for a project? Usually this boils down to timeline, budget, and "scope." 

Budget is the first question many agencies ask. With rare exceptions, it is true that whatever budget you set for a project, your agency will likely meet or exceed that budget. However, playing coy with your budget may not be in your favor. As an agency owner, I always signed time-and-materials contracts with clients based on an estimate. However, I knew that my topline estimate was essentially a "fixed price" bid. If I exceeded that price without a very good reason, my client would be sorely disappointed.

The key is to find agencies that are willing to commit to a budget on "do-not-exceed" terms in a project that satisfies your scope and timeline objects. If possible, get an initial "ballpark" estimate from an agency. This should be possible on your first or second call with the agency after you've discussed the full scope of the project, and the estimate should be based upon their prior experience with similar projects.

Don't balk at the price. If the estimate is much higher than your allocated budget, let them know in a way that respects their experience, but ask how they came to that estimate and how they might scope the project differently. You may have underestimated the project, but it's also very likely that the agency misunderstood the scope. And if the agency has a minimum project size or runrate that won't fit your budget, it's good to identify that early before more time is wasted.

## Tip #3: Don't Set Arbitrary Deadlines

It's best to be immediately up-front about hard deadlines. However, always tie deadlines to a concerete business-critical need. Give the project stakes! It's very hard to motivate an agency team around a deadline that seems arbitrary or keeps moving.

When an agency knows that you have a conference, a major product launch, or some other event coming up, they know the deadline is non-negotiable. Even if the deadline is self-imposed, it helps to be clear about __why__ the deadline is meaingful. When an agency knows that your hard-driving boss needs to see this finished by end of quarter, they may think it's silly, but they'll respect the fact that your job may be on the line.
