**tl;dr**

Your Chevy Volt (or pretty much any other plug-in hybrid) is basically a gas generator with a fat 10kwh battery pack on wheels. During a power outage or while camping, that means you have unlimited electricity without having to start or maintain a generator. All it takes is a fairly inexpensive inverter, a marine fuse, a couple cables, and a rubber band.

## Fire Season Blues

Some people joke that California doesn't have seasons. We could dither over different locals (San Diego is much different than San Francisco or Sacramento), but suffice it to say that our weather does tend to exist within a much narrower band of extremes than most the country. However, we do have one season that is unique: fire season.

By sometime in August through sometime in October, large portions of the  Golden State becomes a BBQ, with 90+ degree days choked with smoke. Because power equipment has been the source of many past fires, our electrical providers now shut down power in targeted areas that are experiencing high winds and hot, dry conditions conducive to fires.

Combined with the normal vagaries of rural living, this means that even if you live in a small town or semi-rural location, the typical Northern Californian house will experience at least a couple days without power each year. As the lights go out, the generators go up, a steady hum that lasts day and night until power is restored. And along with those generators comes cursing at spilled gas, grunting at hauling a 150-pound engine block around on golf caddy wheels, and a load of wonderful exhaust fumes.

## Generators Suck

When we had our first "PSPS" (Public Safety Power Shutoffs, as they're called), I dutifully collected an old Honda generator from my parents. After changing the oil and running some Seafoam through it, I cranked that bad boy up so we could charge some appliances and run a fan for our newborn at night. The generator was too small to run our fridge, so we had to quickly find homes for the bottles full of breast milk (liquid gold!) and anything else we wanted to preserve. Everything else would be sacrificed to the wraith of the utility gods.

After the generator died in the middle of the night, breaking the fan in our son's room, I decided there must be a better way. Buying a bigger generator seemed silly; for thousands of dollars we'd get an engine we'd use a couple times a year. With good maintenance it might last a lifetime, but knowing my record with small engines, I wasn't optimistic.

During the first PSPS, I used a small inverter hooked up to our Chevy Volt to power my laptop and cell phone for a "mobile office" setup. It worked! The Volt had nearly infinite power from its hefty 10kwh battery, and even if it ran out, the gas motor would simply flip on and recharge the battery.

This got me thinking: what if we could run *more* appliances than just a puny laptop? What if, instead of buying a clunky generator, our car already was the generator we needed?

## Finding a Better Way

Looking around on the internet, I found others who had walked this path. While the Volt's 10kwh battery couldn't be modified by a neophyte like myself, a larger inverter could be easily connected to the Volt's traditional car battery. I headed to Amazon and purchased...

### 1. A Pure Sine Inverter.

An inverter converts the 12V direct current (DC) power that a car battery provides to the 120V alternating current (AC) power that a normal house outlet provides. My main goal was to be able to power the fridge, so I found the informational patch on the fridge that details its power requirements:

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SWW6Y7D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07SWW6Y7D&linkCode=as2&tag=alecreynolds-20&linkId=f6a58732edf49b9623da57bc4f34521a"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B07SWW6Y7D&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=alecreynolds-20" ></a>

At first I purchased a 1100W modified sine wave inverter for about $100; extremely cheap versus any comparable generator! However, after reading further, I found that modified sine wave inverters use digital components to approximate a true sine wave in the outputed power, and that this "modified" wave could have detrimental impacts on your appliances.

Thus I ended up spending a little more on a higher quality inverter with a slightly larger (1200W) capacity. I also liked that this inverter came with a remote on/off button, which would allow me to mount it someplace more permanent in my car and turn it on remotely.

### 2. Fuse.

Having no experience with any electrical work, I was curious: what's the worst that can happen with an inverter? One of the big issues I found was the risk of having too much load put on the cables going between the inverter and the battery. Melting a cable or the inverter didn't sound like a good day! To prevent this, I purchased a heavy-duty fuse made for marine and automotive applications:

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071KWT38G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B071KWT38G&linkCode=as2&tag=alecreynolds-20&linkId=f7a123cead8e97683959845c3773f7cb"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B071KWT38G&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=alecreynolds-20" ></a>

This thing is SOLID! In an overload scenario, I felt better that my "circuit" (the complete connections between the battery and inverter) would get broken by the fuse blowing, not a cable or the inverter.

## How to Install

### 1. Secure the inverter and fuse.

After experimenting with the setup, I decided I wanted to permanently install it in the well underneath the Volt's hatchback trunk. There was plenty of room by the battery:

I marked locations for the holes, drilled pilot holes, then used some extra screws from a home project to fasten down both components.

If you're not ready to start drilling holes in your car yet, skip this step and just find a decent place to set everything.

### 2. Connect the Inverter Ground Cable to the Car Chasis.

### 3. Connect the Negative "Black" Terminals.

### 4. Connect the Positive "Red" Terminals.

### 5. Power on The Volt.

Turn on the Volt. By default, the Volt in park will stay on for a while, but eventually will turn off. To get around this, find one or two hefty rubber bands; I love the kind they use to bind together broccoli. Fasten these around the gear shift lever so the button that you press to move the shift between gears is permanently depressed. With the gear shift in "Park", but the trigger down, the car will stay on indefinitely.

WARNING: Obviously you do this at your own risk and should be cognizant of your environment. Now that my son is a little older I'm careful to lock the car so we don't have a Calvin and Hobbes comic replay in our driveway. Also be aware that, whenever your battery runs out and the gas engine turns on, it'll be producing exaust with the attendant risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Again, I'm not an expert and you have to take responsibility here, but make sure your car is outdoors and there isn't a risk that the exhaust could be collecting somewhere dangerous.

### 6. Connect Your Appliances.

Connect them one by one. Be warned that your fridge will have highly variable load. With a 1200W inverter, I can run the fridge and a number of smaller devices. I'm not able to run my fridge and the blower for my heating system, and likewise would need a bigger inverter to run a small AC or electric heater. 1200W really isn't that much!
